# COPULA

This research is aiming to improve searching accuracy by
using copula to integrate different relevance scores (in this research, I used BM25 and query likelihood model to calculate relevance between query and documents)

Copula is a special statistical framework which maps multiple marginal distribution into a simultaneous distribution.

Dataset: ClueWeb09(only english data are used and without Wikipedia data)

PS: This researh is ongoing. I will update more after it is completed.
